## further-info
Hello, world. I'm a curious thinker and teacher who loves to build nifty tools that combine my interests in tech and human injury. Originally a physiotherapist, I have grown to love the different problem-solving nature of being a scientist. Leaving clinical practice in 2022, I embarked on a new and challenging journey to become a researcher deep into machine learning applications. With a practical healthcare background, computer science principles were novel and exciting to me! So, I upskilled, reached out to like-minded researchers and carved a unique path.

## hobbies
Outside of academia and tech, I love watching and analysing sport. NBA, Premier League football and Australian rules football (AFL) all occupy a lot of my spare time. I'm probably the quintessential Aussie who loves fantasy sport, hot dogs and Sydney.

## education
* Bachelor of Physiotherapy (Honours) - Monash University
